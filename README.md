# Rent_a_pet_landing_page

This is a product landing page that I created to improve my HTML and CSS skills. I designed it as part of my learning journey to demonstrate my ability to structure web content, style elements and make the page responsive.

Key Features;

 It uses HTML5 to organize the content.
 CSS3 is applied to make the user interface visually appealing.
 The design follows principles of responsiveness ensuring compatibility, with devices.

Feel free to explore the code and get an idea of my coding style and approach to web development. Please note that "Rent a Pet" is not a company; it's just an example used for this practice project.

Note; This project serves as a showcase of my skills and has no affiliation, with any business entity or organization.
